These are example hooks to tune a multi-objective algorithm (using the
hypervolume indicator). You need to set hookRun and hookEvaluate,
either in the configuration file of irace (usually tune-conf), or in
the command-line (see irace --help), so irace is able to find these
scripts.

Update hook-run with the path, name and fixed parameters of your
program.

Update hook-evaluate with the path and parameters for computing the
hypervolume. The example uses the hypervolume code from
< http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~manuel/hypervolume >. Additional
transformations of the input data may be applied before computing the
hypervolume, such as normalization.
